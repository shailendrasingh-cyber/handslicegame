# HandSliceGame

**HandSliceGame** is an interactive game where players use hand gestures to "slice" falling fruits on the screen. The game is built using MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and OpenCV for video processing.

## About the Project

This project demonstrates the use of computer vision and hand gesture recognition to create a fun and engaging game. Players use their hand gestures to interact with the game by "slicing" falling fruits. The game features a scoring system, adjustable difficulty levels, and a restart option.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection with MediaPipe
- Dynamic fruit spawning and movement
- Scoring system based on slicing fruits
- Adjustable difficulty levels
- Option to restart the game by pressing 'r'
